# Phase Plan (EN)

## Purpose
Phase-based project plan with roles, tasks, and status.

## Core Content
- Phases 0-5 with tasks and exit criteria.
- Status based on the latest project snapshot.

## Phase 2 Summary (EN)
- Hybrid ML is optional and gated by documented evaluation results.
- Explainable scoring spec is documented and aligned to current matcher outputs.
- Streamlit UI exposes strategy toggle and explainability breakdown.

## Lessons Learned (Phase 2)
- Evaluation gating prevents accidental ML activation without evidence.
- Explainability needs to be documented alongside code changes.
